```
## How this is working?
This is an othello game project using the minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning). **Code comments were entered as # comments on each line.**
In the game I developed, Random Player can play against Human(You), Human(You) against ai, ai aganist ai, randomplayer aganist ai.
- *ai.py*: File with AI's algorithm
- *board.py* The file from which the board you see in the console is made
- *game.py*: The file containing the general gameplay and rule blocks of the game
- *human.py*: The human game algorithm. It takes input from you etc.
- *main.py*: The main file. Everything comes together here. You have to run this file to start the game
- *player.py*: Motion functions etc.
- *RandomPlayer.py*: Algorithm for random motion play
